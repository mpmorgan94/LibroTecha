# LibroTecha

<h2>About</h2>
LibroTecha is a simple project I made for practice with web development and database design. The web app is hosted on heroku via a pipeline for CI. <br> <br>
LibroTecha is a web app that connects to a small book database I put together on a PostgreSQL server.
LibroTecha allows users to make accounts and add books to a favorites list as well as search new books.
There are admin roles to update books from the application as well.
